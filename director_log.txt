getSuggestionsByDocumentId function from the database queries to fetch the suggestions and returns them.              \n\n                                                          2. blocks/text.tsx                                                          \n\n ‚Ä¢ This file defines a textBlock using the Block class, which represents a block of text content.                                     \n ‚Ä¢ The initialize method fetches suggestions for the document when the block is created and sets the metadata.                        \n ‚Ä¢ The onStreamPart method handles incoming streaming data, updating the block's content and visibility based on the type of data     \n   received (suggestions or text deltas).

Each bubble can link to a tutorial or demo.\n  - **Interactive Demos:** Allow users to interact with the services directly on your platform, providing a hands-on learning experience.\n- **Customization and Extensibility:**\n  - **User-Created Services:** Enable users to create and deploy their own services on your platform, fostering innovation and collaboration.\n  - **Marketplace for Extensions:** Consider creating a marketplace where users can share or sell their custom-built services.\n- **Monetization Options:**\n  - **Freemium Model:** Offer basic services for free while charging for premium features or advanced services.\n  - **Sponsorships and Donations:** Allow users to support the platform through donations or sponsorships.\n- **Analytics and Feedback:**\n  - **User Analytics:** Implement analytics to track user engagement and service usage, helping you improve the platform.\n  - **Feedback Mechanisms:** Regularly solicit feedback from users to understand their needs and improve the platform.\n\n## Potential Services to Include\n1. **Chatbots:** Integrate various chatbot frameworks for customer support, personal assistants, or educational purposes.\n2. **Image Processing:** Offer tools for image editing, filtering, or analysis.\n3. **Data Visualization:** Provide services for data analysis and visualization, helping users make sense of their data.\n4. **File Storage and Sharing:** Implement a file storage solution for users to upload and share files securely.\n5. **APIs for External Services:** Allow users to connect to external APIs for additional functionality (e.g., weather data, news feeds).\n\n## Conclusion\nBy building a platform that consolidates various open-source services and provides educational resources, you can empower users to learn and create without the burden of paying for multiple subscriptions.
