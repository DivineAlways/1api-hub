    • This file defines a tool for creating documents. It takes a session and a data stream as input.                                                                           
    • The createDocument function generates a unique ID for the document and writes metadata (title, kind) to the data stream.                                                  
    • Depending on the kind of document (text, code, image, or sheet), it uses different AI models to generate content. For example, it streams text for text documents,        
      generates code for code documents, and fetches images for image documents.                                                                                                
    • Finally, it saves the document to the database if a user session is present.

    • It defines a custom provider that includes various language models and an image model. Each model is associated with a specific task (e.g., generating text, reasoning, or
      creating images).                                                                                                                                                         
    • It also defines a list of chat models with descriptions, which can be used to select the appropriate model for different tasks.

    • The updateDocument function retrieves a document by its ID and streams updates based on a provided description.                                                           
    • Similar to the create document function, it handles different document types and saves the updated content back to the database.                                          

Overall, these files work together to provide a comprehensive system for document creation, updating, and suggestion generation, leveraging AI models to enhance user           
productivity and content quality. The use of data streams allows for real-time updates and interactions, making the system responsive to user inputs.
